# 3js_assignment
This was a simple webGL graphics project that I had to do as part of a computer science course, to learn about how textures are rendered to 3D objects and 2D planes.

## Explanation of files in this project

 - index.html:                The home page that loads when the project is opened. 
                              The purpose of the page is to:
                               - set up the layout of the web page
                               - link to the javascript source files
                               - create the "right-click" menu
                               - assign javascript functions to buttons, sliders and menu items
                   
 - styling.css:               This file deals with format and styling of HTML on the page
 
 - scene.js:                  Custom javascript to create and render the scene,  as well as to set up the functions used in index.html above.
 
 - Three.js:                  Downloaded javascript source file for 3js webGL
 
 - RequestAnimationFrame.js:  Downloaded javascript source file, used to animate the scene. (Called between updates to render)
